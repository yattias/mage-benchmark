# mage-benchmark
Benchmarking for Magento API &amp; DB using ruby. Right now the script will
simply benchmark ``customer.info`` soap api call and compare it to the equivalent mysql query.
Feel free to fork and add more complex behavior to it.

##Usage
Clone repo, instructions are in the script. Very simple.

##Requirements
Savon & mysql gems
